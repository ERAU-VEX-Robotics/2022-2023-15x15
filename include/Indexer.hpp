/**
 * \file Indexer.hpp
 * This file contains the class declaration for the Indexer subsystem, which
 * pushes disks into the flywheel from their storage location. Our indexer
 * implementation uses a "puncher". Punchers involve having some object be
 * connected to a motor through the combination of a rack gear and a normal
 * gear. However, the normal gear has had some of its teeth removed, making it
 * into what is called a slip gear. As the gear is rotated by the motor, it
 * pulls the object back because of the rack gear, but once the part of the
 * normal gear that is missing teeth reaches the rack gear, the object is free
 * to move. This object also has rubber bands connected to it that cause it to
 * move toward the disk when nothing is holding it back.
